<h3>Boyhood</h3>
<p>
    This beautiful, mysterious movie is a time-lapse study of Mason, growing up from around the age of five to 18, 
    from primary school to his first day in college. It is an intimate epic: over 12 years, Linklater worked with 
    the young actor Ellar Coltrane, shooting scenes every year with him and other cast members, who grow visibly 
    and heart-stoppingly older around him. The director's daughter, Lorelei Linklater, plays Mason's older sister,
    Samantha; Patricia Arquette is superb as their divorced single mom, hard-working and aspirational, but worryingly
    condemned to hook up with drunks and give the kids abusive stepdads. Ethan Hawke - his lean, chiselled face softening
    as the years go by - plays the kids' feckless and unreliable but charming father, who shows up every few weeks in his
    cool car. And Mason's own face changes from its young, moony openness to a closed, grown-up handsomeness. It is the
    face he will learn to present to the world.

<h3>The Place Beyond the Pines</h3>
<p>
    I had no idea what to expect from this, but I'd seen and liked Ryan Gosling in DRIVE so I thought I'd give it a go.
    And the director has clearly been taking a few pointers from that film, because stylistically it's very similar:
    slow paced, scenes shot the same way, the same type of music. Hell, even Gosling is playing a similar character,
    a guy who best communicates through violent action.

    The first hour of this film is fantastic: gripping, edge-of-the-seat stuff, with another excellent performance
    from the star. Then things go in a different direction for the second hour, with the less-interesting Bradley 
    Cooper becoming the focus of the story. This part's still pretty good, if more familiar. It all rounds out again 
    with a third act which ups the suspense to a satisfying climax.

<h3>20th century women</h3>
<p>
    20th Century Women isn't about giving us some epic look at a group of friends or a family, but it is about the passage
    of time with people who are warm and caring and in a genuine way. Mike Mills isn't a saccharine filmmaker, but he also
    doesn't shy away from sentiment - I always have to point out this is separate from sentimentality - and the feeling
    that I came away with from the comedy 20th Century Women is this warmth from all of the characters, and this feeling 
    that I know these people, whether I did or didn't (and I actually did in the sense that, at times, the mother and son
    were me and my mom for a short period of my teenage years, so there's an authenticity just there to me).
